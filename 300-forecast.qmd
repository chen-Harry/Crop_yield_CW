# Temperature Forecast Model

To investigate the effect of increasing temperature on crop yield, I first fitted a model for the average annual temperature data. I assumed a quadratic trend in the temperature, with some non-parametric fluctuations modelled by a Gaussian process with an RBF kernel, with scale parameter $\alpha$ and lengthscale $\rho$. The time $t$ has been linearly transformed to fall within the interval $[-1, 1]$. $$
\begin{align}
T_t &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu_t, \sigma^2) \\
\mu_t &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \beta_2 t^2 + f(t) \\
f &\sim \text{GP}(\alpha, \rho) \\
\alpha & \sim \text{Half-Cauchy}(0,1) \\
\rho & \sim \text{Inv-Gamma}(5, 1) \\
\beta_0 & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 10^2) \\
\beta_1, \, \beta_2 & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\sigma & \sim \text{Half-Normal}(0,1)
\end{align}
$$ The goal is to be able to use this model to forecast the temperature for the next 10 years based on historic data. In order to efficiently sample from the posterior of the Gaussian process, I have used a fast Hilbert Space approximation [(Riutort-Mayol, G., BÃ¼rkner, PC., Andersen, M.R. et al. 2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11408). Some of the stan code used to implement this was copied from the MATH70073 - Advanced Bayesian Methods course notes.

The model provides an adequate fit to the data, and captures the inherent uncertainty underlying the data. There is a clear non-stationary increasing trend in the last 50 or so years.

# Impact on Crop Yield

Using the forecast values for temperature, and combined with the previous model for crop yield, we can predict the impact of increasing temperature on yield. For this purposes we shall assume a constant annual precipitation based on the average over the last 10 years. The forecast is based on the log-normal model's median, $\exp(\hat{\mu}_{i,t})$.

The forecast for wheat and barley appears to be somewhat reasonable given historic data. The forecast for rapeseed appears to be overly confident in its predictions. As a sanity check, forecast appears to be consistent with the previous results, which showed that wheat is the most sensitive to increases in temperature, and rapeseed the least sensitive.
