# Goals

The project shall aim to study the effect of precipitation and temperature on crop yield. 

# Data

* The data on crop yield was obtained from the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL/metadata), which includes various data on crops and livestock products from across the world. The project shall mainly focus on data for the United Kingdom. 
* The data for precipitation was obtained from [Out World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-precipitation-per-year), and records the average precipitation for countries on an annual basis. 
* The data for temperature was obtained from the [World Bank Group](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/united-kingdom/climate-data-historical#:~:text=The%20UK). It contains historic data on the mean surface air temperature.

We shall mainly be looking at 3 crops: wheat, barley, and rapeseed, which represent the 3 most popular crops grown in the UK(TODO: citation).

There appears to be a general trend of better crop yield over time. The yield of all 3 crops appears to be highly correlated, suggesting that they have common causes.

![Crop yield against temperature](./outputs/100-eda/temp_yield.png "Yield against temperature of Crops in the UK")

We can see clearly that for each crop the yield is positively correlated with annual precipitation and average temperature.
