title: "Crop Yield Project"
---

This is a website outlining a project on crop yield in the UK. The project aims to model the relationship between the yield of 3 crops, barley, rapeseed, and wheat, against temperature and precipitation. It then aims to use this model to forecast the yield of crops in the future by projecting expected trend in temperature.
